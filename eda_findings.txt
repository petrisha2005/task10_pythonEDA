EDA FINDINGS – TASK 10

1. Dataset Overview
The dataset contains ____ rows and ____ columns.
Both numerical and categorical variables are present.

2. Missing Value Analysis
Some columns contain missing values, which were identified using percentage calculation.
Columns with very high missing values were noted for further handling.

3. Distribution Analysis
Histograms showed that some numerical variables are skewed.
Boxplots revealed the presence of outliers in certain columns.

4. Outlier Detection
Outliers were detected using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
Values outside 1.5 × IQR were considered as outliers.

5. Outlier Treatment
Outliers were handled using capping to avoid data loss and reduce skewness.

6. Correlation Analysis
Correlation was performed only on numerical features.
Strong positive and weak correlations were observed among some variables.
